                    <p>If you don't wear glasses now, the chances are that you're going to need to after an upcoming sports accident. Praying to false gods never seemed so good after this week. You may become friends with a self-proclaimed tribal warrior named Alf.</p>

                    <p>You must decide how to continue today, whether it's by questioning everything that happens or, instead, letting it all wash over you like the water from maiden's bathwater. Which may or may not be related to how important your questioning becomes.</p>

                    <p>Money is literally no object for you this week as you lose all your money. Silver foil can make a good hat, it's true. However, it can also be used as a sheathe should you find yourself lucky one lunchtime. Discarded sandwiches may prove lucky for any local tramps.</p>
