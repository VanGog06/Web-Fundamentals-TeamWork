        <h1>History</h1>
        <article class="story">
            <p>It all started 4 years ago when a powerful wizard named Master Mag Nakov was gazing at his crystal ball.
                He was focused yet relaxed as his hands were gently touching the round glass looking for a solution to a
                problem which had him losing sleep for months. <span>There just aren't enough quality wizards out there, he thought.</span>But
                on that day the stars aligned and something extraordinary happened. Mag Nakov quickly grabed a piece
                of paper and started writing. It took him
                10 days and 10 nights until the spark of creative genius faded and when the paper was finished he cried
                of joy. He knew he'd done it. The Master Mag had created the best and most comprehensive course on
                witchcraft in the world.</p>
            <p>Ten months later he found Us the only three people in the world who were interested in what he had to
                teach. So we followed the program and after 2 short years we became the most respected wizards in our
                areas of expertise.</p>
